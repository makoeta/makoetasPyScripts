Hello, this is my public repo for my python scripts. I just work here whenever I get an idea for a new "_useful_" script.




### Notes for the scripts
* descCleaner: you need to create a "descPath.txt" in the same directory. In this file you need to write the path to the desktop in the first line and a name of the "Sorted" directory in the second line.
